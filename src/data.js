And then you have to rewrite your whole app three times.<p>Building any app will leave you delirious, but I’ve found myself far more productive in <em>React<\/em> Native than the alternatives - and I’ve tried them. I would happily challenge anyone to ship a cross platform app using their framework of choice and compare on time to ship and ultimate UX. I think there’s a clear winner.",

This model continued with various adjustments for going on two years. Just yesterday an e-mail was sent out company-wide from the Executive Council, which detailed a plan to have the entirety of the company return to office for at least 3 days a week starting October 1st, 2023.
